# PyWordle

I enjoy playing wordle and thought it would be fun to make a few small side projects based on it.

Ideas:
- command line version of the game
- set up a basic pipeline with github actions
- build a nicer version with pygame
- build a tool to suggest next guesses or viable solutions
- build it in another language 
- use kivy (or an alternative to make it into a mobile app)
- host my own version of it on the cloud
