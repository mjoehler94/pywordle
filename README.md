# wordle_cli

Wordle is a simple game and makes for a great learning tool for programmers. I built a version of wordle that is playable from the commandline as an excuse to learn a few things that I've been wanting to try for a while.

- setting up a ci pipeline with github actions
- getting a better grasp of pylint and pytest
- practice using vim keybindings in vs code
- using the blessings library instead of curses

I also have some other ideas that I came up with as I was working on it. Hopefully I will get to them later. 

Ideas (in no particular order):
- [x] command line version of the game
- [x] set up a basic pipeline with github actions
- [ ] build a nicer version with pygame
- [ ] build a tool to suggest next guesses or viable solutions
- [ ] build it in another language 
- [ ] use kivy (or an alternative to make it into a mobile app)
- [ ] host my own version of it on the cloud
- [ ] learn to use sphinx (or another tool) for setting up documentation
- use pylenium to play the game each day and send me the results
- track results in a database
